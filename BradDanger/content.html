Largely because he didn&#39;t drive. Rather he couldn&#39;t drive, he had never bothered learning how on account of the hired drivers and what not. So the mental anguish, the emotional damage, the dread a blonde spiky-haired young rapper should be feeling within this luminal space distorting the color spectrum with its long lines and &#34;Calling #203&#34; just didn&#39;t click with him. <br /><br />Shimmying off his yellow jacket and dropping it to the floor, the rapper&#39;s white wife beater stretched over his thin but admittedly well built torso and exposing bare arms were only pierced in contrast by the sky blue headband and amazing Nike Sox kicks at his feet. He had.. an item. What was it? Nothing Nexus Approved, that was for sure.<br /><br />You see, in the previous contest of strength, B-Rad had fought against a futuristic bounty hunter or hitman or something of that nature known as Lux. Granted, this was after the rapper forgot why he was there and befriended the prison population, entering a routine for three months straight of being the hardest white man in the whole correctional facility other than all the murderers and what not. Then to top it off, that Lucks fella had the nerve to rudely initiate their interaction by throwing grenades at ghosts in an air duct or something. Weirdizzle. <br /><br />But now that the OG of OGs remembered why he was here, he wouldn&#39;t repeat the same mistake. You see, it was all about quelling player hating. Clearly, Lux had been confused and mistakenly concluded B-Rad was a buster. That just wasn&#39;t true. So, this time armed with the name of his opponent and drunken murmuring at the intergalactic bar or whatever, and with brief signal service - the plan would come into action.<br /><br />This Danger guy was Latinx or something. <br /><br />And B-Rad was like, 45% sure they loved this shit.

Something very interesting was surely going behind them.  Hid away from the rest of the world.  Safe from the sight of the B-Rads of the world.  Never to be dissed.  Never to be served.  Never to be dabbed on, if that was also a thing B-Rad did.  I am unclear on that.<br /><br />With a mighty kick one of those temporary fold out bitch ass cubicle wall things falls over.  As it does so all the calendars and children&#39;s pictures and obnoxious motivational posters come loose and fly up into the air.  The wall itself hit a fat fuck in a polo shirt and khaki shorts.  The violent crash immediately liquifies right right shoulder and pushed his spinal cord out behind him.<br /><br />&#34;<i>Ohhhhh.  Oh god no.  Nooooo.  It hurts.  It hurts so much.  Why me.  What did I do wrong.  Please please finish me off.  The pain it is unbearable.  Grant me the sweet release of death I beg you.</i>&#34;<br /><br />He shouted out very quickly.  Surprisingly eloquent and clear given the state of his body.  He still sounded like a bitch though.  Surprisingly fitting actually because his spinal cord kind of looked like a tail, jutting out from his back like that, dripping blood and cerebral spinal fluid.<br /><br />So he sounded like a bitch in the derogatory sense, moaning about how much that hurt, but he also looked like a bitch in the female dog sense due to the spinal tail.<br /><br />Back up in not Cripple Bitch Loser Land stands Danger, Danger Fontaine.  Strong tree trunk like legs seemed to stretch his wrestling gear to the absolute limit of their spandexery.  Probably also his huge penis but only a gay would notice that.  You gay man.  I know you see it.  I seent you seenting it.  It&#39;s ok I don&#39;t judge.  The judges are here for that.

Oh sure, he had heard plenty of reports that the Latinx were dangerous individuals when in gang culture, but to see it first hand was.. astonishing. The random people in the background that didn&#39;t matter at all because they were poor were completely annihilated in front of his eyes, a blood gore explosion to signal real ultra violence.<br /><br />In the back of Brad&#39;s mind, he could feel it calling. A similar feeling he felt once before when in a life threatening scenario. Now he remembered. <br /><span class="code-block-wrapper"><span class="code-block">It was a cold snowy day. A young B-Rad from Malibu was invited onto a particular Fox News‚Ñ¢ television show. The audience clapped as it cold opened with a jingle.<br /><br />&#34;Good evening and WELCOME to Tucker Carlson. It&#39;s a happy Tuesday! Like ALL Californian oligarchs, Governor Bill Gluckman doesn&#39;t -hide- that he hates you, especially if you&#39;re a working class family.&#34; A messy haired TV host in a suit and tie sits at a desk with a backdrop of the United States Capitol building on display behind him. Finishing his last sentence while staring ominously at the camera, he adds &#34;The question is, why does HIS family, especially his children who could easily assassinate the rogue governor and /save/ California, hate you and all Americans so much?&#34; Voice entering a shrill mixture of mocking glee and righteous indignation, Tucker raises his right arm. &#34;Here to answer that question tonight, please welcome Brad Gluckman, son of Governor Bill Gluckman, who joins us now. Thank you very much, Brad, first to you: why do you want American children to die?&#34;<br /><br />Remote interviewing in from abroad, B-Rad sitting in his gamer chair wearing an all-white variant of his rapper outfit seemed stunned and struggling to find words. <br /><br />&#34;Uh.. t-thank you Mr. Tucker Carlson, uhm.. well, I don&#39;t.. first off like, I don&#39;t really think my dad is a bad guy-&#34;</span></span></p>    <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div> </div></div><div class="msg" style="flex-direction: row;" id="1032006672266301550"> <div class="col bad-date-container" style="width: 5.5vh"> <p class="bad-date">12:06</p> </div> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <p class="msg-content sel"></p>  <video class="gif" style="width: 221.2px; height: 169.39999999999998px" autoplay muted loop> <source src="https://media.tenor.com/ulZRVQojCEQAAAPo/blink-seriously.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Update your browser, idiot!</video>  <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div></div><div class="msg" style="flex-direction: row;" id="1032006693841797120"> <div class="col bad-date-container" style="width: 5.5vh"> <p class="bad-date">12:06</p> </div> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <p class="msg-content sel"><span class="code-block-wrapper"><span class="code-block">Blinking with a thousand yard stare of disbelief, Tucker leaned interrupted by waving his hand before glibly replying &#34;B-rad, is that what you call yourself?

LatinX <i>and</i> a fellow Lyricologist? There was no other explanation for rhymes that fire being dropped in rapid succession so soon after deploying his own verbal bombardment. <br /><br />This was, allegedly, a battle of muscle and will. However, it turned out this was also a battle of rap. <br /><br />Unfortunately for Danger, that was a field Brad was a genius at. Well, at first he wasn&#39;t, cause his dad kept paying off venues to declare he won. But he confronted his pops and ol Big B told him that it&#39;d never happen again. So from there on, the 198 wins and 0 losses B-Rad experienced were all authentically earned. <br /><br />Yeah, the &#34;Nexus&#34; was important and all and would get dealt with in due time. There was no mistaking that. However, this was <u>way</u> more important right now.<br /><br />Beginning to throw hand signs in front of his chest, B-Rad snorted air out of his nostrils and hummed a few times in a low tone to set up the beat as by now, the YouTube video on his disposed of iPhone, one of millions, had stopped playback as it desired YouTube red to run in the background. No matter. He would produce his own tunes.<br /><br />&#34;Go &#39;head and move, rook, smoking tobacco!<br />Call me the big cheese of the C.O.

On and on this rap went. It started out bitch made. There was no denying that. The prose was weak, the rhymes were unsteady. But gradually like a rising crescendo, its pure balling energy captured the audience, and sent them into rapture.  It was like if you took a Martin Luther King Jr speech on racial inequality and a schizophrenic&#39;s explanation of how the sun rotated around the earth, and fused them over a holy chorus of rap fueled psychosis made divine. <br /><br /><i>Like peanuts not penis</i>.. good lord.<br /><br />Though no physical strikes had been exchanged, B-Rad was indeed sweaty. That mic drop led to an audience uproar. The DMV employees and random passerby waiting in line erupted in cheers as the light spectrum seemed to fluctuate between green, red, and blue; all ensnared by the LatinX wrestler&#39;s incredible lyrical prowess. <br /><br />This was it. <br /><br />A spotlight shone down on B-Rad. Maybe it was in his head. Maybe it wasn&#39;t.<br /><br />&#34;<i>No homo, just me solo</i>&#34; - this was the moment his body had been waiting for in all of these many years of harsh rap battles. B-Rad had to work very hard, to overcome his skin color in this genre of musical prowess. That and overcome his status as the rich son of governor of California Bill Gluckman of course. Like in a Japanese Role-playing Game, he would grind and grind experience to overcome any weakness and every obstacle, that much was a certainty. Here, this man known as [<i>Danger</i>] - apropos name indeed - had shown himself to be a gangster fresh off the streets without a doubt. <br /><br />However, it was not just nervous energy or even fear, that filled B-Rad now. It was more.. <br /><br />Resignation.<br /><br />That he knew he had to do something now. <br /><br />Though strong in his jabs on B-Rad&#39;s mother may she rest in divorce court, what stood before the mic dropped Fontaine was no longer the youthful innocent lad named B-Rad but instead beware, Brad Gluckman&#39;s cold icy eyes full of an almost -- sadness?</p>    <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div> </div></div><div class="msg" style="flex-direction: row;" id="1032334379260837918"> <div class="col bad-date-container" style="width: 5.5vh"> <p class="bad-date">09:48</p> </div> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <p class="msg-content sel">Left hand grasping his forehead audibly as its fingers draped over his eyes, a solemn voice exited the rapper: &#34;So na√Øve. You have no idea, do you? What a pity.. you make an original gangster cry.&#34; Dramatically letting the left arm drop, he began walking sideways slowly, body language more calm and unnaturally relaxed. The cheers and aroused female average age of 50 underwear slinging began dying down as the crowd looked on in mounting concern at how palpable the energy in the air was- this.. battle intensity.<br /><br />&#34;<b>Arrogant</b>, crude little shits like you come around from time to time. You get the flow down and improv, get the crowd yelling, oh sure... but can you do it <i>consistently?</i> Listen well, Rapper-Fon. The wall is high...&#34; <i>Step. Step.</i> &#34;Higher than you will <i>ever</i> know. Ultimate sacrifice is sublime..&#34; <br /><br />Pivot, squeak- his Nikes gave friction to the DMV floor as B-Rad faced Fontaine dead on, a marginal distance closer than before.<br /><br />&#34;<b>And that is why you will die to this rhyme. EY.</b>&#34; <br /><br />Head bobbing lower than his shoulder blades, his sweat had turned hot - as had the air itself.<br /><br />&#34;Bitch, you will die! <br />I will sodomize you, ratify~<br />That&#39;s why I make a stirra stirra stir fry!<br />I don&#39;t really like drinking tea, chai.<br /><br />My raps are beastful, I ain&#39;t ever shy!!<br />So to your bozo LYRICS, I will nullify~ EY!&#34;<br /><br />The ground shook with people&#39;s palpitations, feeling this manic energy within their very souls.<br /><br /> &#34;I gotta ask, let me ask you to specify, and make you amplify! <b>OH!</b><br />Cause now that I fight a fellow rap <u>SAMURAI</u>,<br />Harakiri Danger, Miyamoto MusashAi, time to say goodbye.<br />On account MY LYRICOLOGY is succinct and in no short <b>SUPPLY,</b>&#34;<br /><br />The moment.<br /><br />That dire moment that changed everything.

No, there wasn&#39;t a word language could use to describe what this was. <br /><br />But rather than be dismayed his dark secret finisher couldn&#39;t topple Danger, as the perspiration fueled super rap rose in response, Brad Gluckman felt something even stronger. <i>Euphoria</i>. <br /><br />To become a real OG, you had to do many things. Kill some busters. Rap fierce. Go to prison. Avoid getting your butt pillaged in prison, or at least keep it on the down low. And this <i>Nexus</i>, this primordial vortex of super combatants, had delivered in spades had it not? Prison, street cred, murders, and now. Now the most endurable enemy rapper B-Rad had ever encountered, coming back from each verbal haymaker to stand strong and drop another line. Stiches and Richards - that was wordplay and alliteration not unlike the greatest scholars of fables many told.<br /><br />And yet. B-Rad was not done.<br /><br />A rap battle may seem to the layman like two guys insulting each other and mumbling somewhat incoherently to a beat while passerby watch drunk high and confused - &#39;crunked&#39; some may call it - but the real essence of it came down to a battle of wills. In a marathon race, was it always the fastest who won? <i>No</i>, it was he who could keep his brain on the prize, refuse his body&#39;s signals to surrender, keep cool in the heat of the race; that person would inevitably invariably prove victorious. And although his skin was certainly reddened from the heat and intensity of these bars, breathing somewhat labored - Brad <b>was cool as a cucumber within.</b> <br /><br />The crowd was in rapture over Fontaine. But B-Rad had an audience that mattered <u>way</u> more.  Who kept him going so deep into this dark hour?<br /><br />Why. <i>Friendship</i>.</p>    <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div> </div></div><div class="msg" style="flex-direction: row;" id="1032778506301620264"> <div class="col bad-date-container" style="width: 5.5vh"> <p class="bad-date">15:13</p> </div> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <p class="msg-content sel"></p> <img class="image sel" src="media/1032778505949302824.png" style="width: 124px; height: 127px;">   <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div></div><div class="msg" style="flex-direction: row;" id="1032778516665737277"> <div class="col bad-date-container" style="width: 5.5vh"> <p class="bad-date">15:13</p> </div> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <p class="msg-content sel"><b>G&#39;Loc</b>, his best buddy in prison before the man&#39;s untimely demise through means unknown, who always reminded B-Rad to keep himself tucked into his blankets good so nobody could do butt stuff to him at night while he was sleepin&#39; and what not?

It was considered a miracle that he had managed to knock up Mrs. Gluckman, and Brad&#39;s birth something of a miracle. But as it would turn out that July school night where the rapper to be was spying on his parents fighting through the stair rails covered in gold and ivory: he was no Jesus Christ. And this. This was no miracle.<br /><br />Bill had been impotent. That is to say, his semen couldn&#39;t &#34;do the job,&#34; and he would often go to bath houses to wrestle with men. This made Mrs. Gluckman very upset, and in a moment of weakness, she sought out the comfort of a man. A tanned, glistening muscle bound warrior of a man. <br /><br />&#34;<i>You have my rap permission</i>~&#34; Danger finished, assuredly dropping an actual receipt to signify that B-Rad had just been served. Yet eerily, there were no signs of Brad being served at all. It is as though he had somehow completely resisted the rap salvo.

He had seen it on the face of many an opponent upon their realization he was about to fuck them up.  He had seen it on the faces of several undercover cops selling him drugs, for similar reasons.  He had seen it on the face of many a prostitute too, for similar reasons.  Soul searching.  Flashbacks.  Hoping Danger actually had the cash.<br /><br />But he had sensed it.  From the very first moment.  A certain tingling.  A Danger Sense.  Sensing danger.  In his balls.  A certain tightening of the scrotum.  As though his balls recognized the presence of one of their homies.  Granted it had been some time, and their ballsack homie was now a full grown man.  But just like the wise men say &#34;Testicles Never Forget-icles&#34;<br /><br />Danger, Danger Fontaine went into a flashback of his own.  But not concerning B-Rad, since he had just now met him in the Arena of Rapology.

But he was mad committed to blowing her back out.  You understand?<br /><br />Like this wasn&#39;t some romantic movie stuff where like the sheets cover just over her boobs and just barely over his groinal vicinity.  It wasn&#39;t even like some more modern movie type shit where they&#39;re both butt ass naked and you&#39;re constantly trying to crane your neck so you can see around the dude ass Hollywood seems to love to show.  And what&#39;s up with that man I&#39;m trying to  see some tiddies and legs and all them good bits why you got some fucking guys ass up in my face?  You trying to make me gay bro?  It wasn&#39;t even like that.<br /><br />This was like some National Geographic shit but like the parts that they cut before they put it out.  Like the parts you know some weird fucker collects and stitches together and sells like bootlegged tapes of off like I don&#39;t know Melrose and Sunrise.   each or 3 for  so you might as well just get the three, I mean that&#39;s just good business.<br /><br />It was like that.<br /><br />&#34;Pa.

It might&#39;ve been the most homoerotic activity two allegedly heterosexual men could engage in that had occurred within this omniversal contest of strength, and that was quite a feat given the antics some galaxy warriors got up to; yet that was okay.

It was difficult to perform but anyone who watched old heavyweight boxing shows on recommendation from various rappers pretending they themselves frequently boxed could pick it up, if they had the natural aptitude, and the reward was an extremely hard to predict shot even if you knew it was coming. Aimed right at Danger&#39;s chest, as B-Rad melted into a pendulum step in and back. <br /><br />And boy was B-Rad&#39;s something. For an understanding, Muhammad Ali&#39;s &#34;bee stings&#34; were recorded to come in at 12 punches in just 2.8 seconds; at times, his jab could smash a board 16.5&#34; away in 19/100ths of a second, covering the distance in 4/100ths of a second which is the blink of an eye. But Muhammad Ali was, ultimately, just a mortal man. He could not accelerate to mach three, or throw punches in the realm of the superhuman. And although the rapper&#39;s father was <i>strong</i> as well as all warriors within the competition having comparable physical parameters, there was no denying the harsh truth: in terms of <i>alacrity</i>, nobody matched B-Rad. So evasive and flighty, cheap little attacks like this -- could not be topped by anyone on the roster save the harsh renounced Gluckman. Put simply: although Danger seemed <u>far</u> too strong for this to fell him, it was unlikely he&#39;d be capable of more than a parry.<br /><br />But why?<br /><br />Why in the eve of this lyrical drag down battle and the nearing reconciliation of a father and son, did B-Rad do something so heinous and cheap?<br /><br /><b>Because that&#39;s what rappers do.</b> Now that he had met his dad&#39;s, why, it was time to make up for all that time they missed.

However. <br /><br />What relevance <i>did</i> rap have to combat? Some warriors of different times and circumstances would scoff at it. They were of course, fools. Battle is <u>all about</u> rhythm. This is why primitive tribes could strike above their weight limit with dance-like maneuvers, why those in chains would mask their combat approach in dance, why great armies went to a drumbeat; if you can pick up on certain rules and signs, you can leave your body to the rhythm and simply let yourself dance to it. And through his obsessive lust for rap fame coupled with his genetic predisposition for combat, <i>this</i> was why B-Rad was such a natural in combat.<br /><br />You could call it a language that the layman didn&#39;t speak, but could if exposed enough.

As those failed, the escalation kept going but B-Rad never seemed to tire, never seemed to take pause. Machine guns, rocket launchers, mortars, plastic explosives, metahumans, lasers; time and time again, he was defying convention and those whom took notice disapproved furiously. But they didn&#39;t matter. Youthful lads like him armed with gats, or olden warriors with samurai blades and disapproving looks mentally chastising B-Rad; they&#39;d all get folded to death before he&#39;d even be late for an appointment to see bitches he had arranged to bang off their premium Snapchats.<br /><br />He only worked out or practiced to show off on his social media; everything about his fighting approach, <b>everything</b>, was intuitive.

A few desks - <i>khipop!</i> Wood dust remained. <br /><br />Looking like a goofy Olympiad runner that was recorded on a VHS tape set to 40x fast forward, a VHS tape for you younger folks in the audience is an arcane block that would be shoved into a device to render video, B-Rad had bitched out entirely making quick distance. <br /><br />It was time for his kill routine. <br /><br />And he had to get warmed up for that.  A preparation if you will. A preparation for the <b>DRILL.</b>‚Ñ¢Ô∏è <br /><br /><span class="inline-code">Note: THE DRILL is a deadly technique of becoming a humanoid drill by leveraging one&#39;s speed and durability to their utmost limits to run through a foe. It is not a power as much as B-Rad applying his attributes &#34;logically,&#34; and is named because he watched too much anime one summer, not because he has actually transmogrified into a drill. Although that would be really cool.</span></p>    <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div></div><div class="seperator-date"><span class="seperator-date-content">October 27, 2022</span></div><div class="msg">  <div class="row" style="justify-content: flex-start;"> <img class="pfp" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/230980141872971776/b2ce9e841bbe4a16ec60e10b56cbc6ac.webp?size=256"> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <div class="msg-info"> <h3 class="msg-username sel">Bango</h3> <span class="msg-date sel">Thu 27/10/2022 06:36:35 PM</span> </div> <p class="msg-content sel">At the sight of his prodigal son...wait is it still a prodigal son if you abandon it?

Just that &#34;tap&#34; earlier flooded his synapses with all relevant information he needed: Danger was a thick boy. Or adult. Mostly adult. As to be expected, B-Rad jumped off a skyscraper for a music video and survived the fall when he was four so his father would have to be comparable if not significantly stronger. <br /><br />There was a desire that was treated as almost a meme among karate practitioners, of which B-Rad was not but had hung out with instructors on set at his mansion, known as the <i>ONE HIT</i>. The dream of a perfect single strike that could pierce any armor, fell any tall tree, and render an opponent crushed in but one blow. His first jab, while not weak, wasn&#39;t anywhere close.

You need to understand: a Formula 1 race car topped out around 186 miles per hour. If they hit a wall, their kinetic energy converts into internal energy; that internal energy.. does some horrifying shit. Take the incident with driver Jim Clark, who hit a tree at 170 MPH. Now if the situation played out roughly the same, there are many factors at play; maybe the tree bends and breaks, maybe the car crumples. Maybe the tree is knocked down and the car keeps going with some velocity less than its initial form. All that really matters, is that in the real world, whenever a collision takes place - part of the interacting bodies compresses and the compressed portions thereof in turn exert a resistivity force. <br /><br />In a layman&#39;s terms..<br /><br />B-Rad, who was moving 13.5x faster than that speedway race car at top speed, was a nightmare even with his goofy posture. The building, massive as it was with this being the DMV to end all DMVs, was shuddering like heartbeat palpitations from his feet liquefying the floor tiling with each step, as his shoulders would rend human flesh and bone with each passing dullard that couldn&#39;t push out of the way. Quickly, B-Rad was becoming <b>a red wave of death</b>, as his feet were getting more conditioned to run on the floor. Calories were burning, a runner&#39;s high was kicking in, his feet were arching <i>just right</i>; yeah.. <i>yeah!</i> He was figuring out what felt good, that right balance, that right sway to bisect a man. <br /><br /><span class="code-block-wrapper"><span class="code-block">Two preps for THE DRILL.

That&#39;d honestly be a lot cooler but he wasn&#39;t going to pop his pop&#39;s bubble and tell him that. <br /><br />Finally veering to make that home run slam towards his father, the Gluckman without a cuckman, heh, alliteration, was glad to see his father was no buster. Suddenly, saying he was Brad&#39;s father didn&#39;t sound so awkward after all. Very well. No tricks or sleight of hand. This was going to be one for the books. Tiles would disintegrate from his <i>perfect</i> running condition. <br /><br />An old adage about the immovable object and the unstoppable force was about to be tested. Now there was no denying Danger was a thick man. A thick, <i>thick</i> man. Not fat, let&#39;s not get this twisted, he was just durable. Like hitting a brick wall, but B-Rad was easily able to sunder 8,000 of those so, you know, whatever a brick wall would typically entail for a metahuman with supernatural physical feats. And if he was putting effort into guarding, that brick wall just got ten feet higher. Unfortunately for Fontaine, B-Rad had grown up in California. Cali-forn-i-A, yeah. And aliens came through there all the time, the illegal kind and the intergalactic variety. And either way, B-Rad fucked them up and then had his apparent step-dad pay off the police to ignore what he did. <br /><br />Point being, if the wall&#39;s that high, he just needed to bust through.<br /><br />&#34;<b>AHHHGGGGGGGG</b>&#34; Screamed the humanoid bullet though bullets didn&#39;t have <i>shit</i> on him now.<br /><br />He understood what the idea was. Become a rock that would halt B-Rad&#39;s charge and, either after taking the hit, or perhaps a little bit before, land a counter. But he wasn&#39;t no bitch. He had long ago surpassed his bio father on the field of rap battle, and this would be no different! It&#39;d be like.. like if he turned around dramatically and thrust his fist through his dad&#39;s chest and went &#34;wawww!&#34;</p>    <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div> </div></div><div class="msg" style="flex-direction: row;" id="1036818684762665101"> <div class="col bad-date-container" style="width: 5.5vh"> <p class="bad-date">18:47</p> </div> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <p class="msg-content sel">Yeah.

Why.. it was somewhere on the abdomen Danger had been so proud of. Muscles flexing with what amounted to super armor, abdominal bracing they call it, was no small thing. With enough training, you could cushion harsh strikes and come back swinging. However, bracing had limitations. Although B-Rad&#39;s eyes were on his father&#39;s in the meteoric charge to the finish, his target was lower and dead simple: the solar plexus.<br /><br />No doubt his father could handle a beating, and no doubt his father intended to land something on the oncoming humanoid comet- but his posture even with the harshest of flexing left him wide open to land that fist and fucking <i>sink it through</i>. <br /><br />Nothing else mattered. If Danger clapped his jaw, if Danger stood his ground, if Danger revealed he had a weapon last second, if he went for a trip, if he went for a snag, all of that would cause great damage to B-Rad but the die was cast for the superior blow. The kind that can put a man made of steel on the floor like soft jelly. <br /><br /><b>The Drill.</b> Coming to a nervous system near you.</p>    <div class="row reaction-wrapper"></div> </div></div><div class="msg">  <div class="row" style="justify-content: flex-start;"> <img class="pfp" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/230980141872971776/b2ce9e841bbe4a16ec60e10b56cbc6ac.webp?size=256"> <div class="msg-content-wrapper"> <div class="msg-info"> <h3 class="msg-username sel">Bango</h3> <span class="msg-date sel">Mon 31/10/2022 07:19:01 PM</span> </div> <p class="msg-content sel">&#34;<i>Ho Ho Ho, You Approach Me?!?! </i>&#34;<br /><br />Danger, Danger Fontaine might have thought to himself if he were a giant fucking weeb.

Largely because he didn't drive. Rather he couldn't drive, he had never bothered learning how on account of the hired drivers and what not. So the mental anguish, the emotional damage, the dread a blonde spiky-haired young rapper should be feeling within this luminal space distorting the color spectrum with its long lines and "Calling #203" just didn't click with him. 

Shimmying off his yellow jacket and dropping it to the floor, the rapper's white wife beater stretched over his thin but admittedly well built torso and exposing bare arms were only pierced in contrast by the sky blue headband and amazing Nike Sox kicks at his feet. He had.. an item. What was it? Nothing Nexus Approved, that was for sure.

You see, in the previous contest of strength, B-Rad had fought against a futuristic bounty hunter or hitman or something of that nature known as Lux. Granted, this was after the rapper forgot why he was there and befriended the prison population, entering a routine for three months straight of being the hardest white man in the whole correctional facility other than all the murderers and what not. Then to top it off, that Lucks fella had the nerve to rudely initiate their interaction by throwing grenades at ghosts in an air duct or something. Weirdizzle. 

But now that the OG of OGs remembered why he was here, he wouldn't repeat the same mistake. You see, it was all about quelling player hating. Clearly, Lux had been confused and mistakenly concluded B-Rad was a buster. That just wasn't true. So, this time armed with the name of his opponent and drunken murmuring at the intergalactic bar or whatever, and with brief signal service - the plan would come into action.

This Danger guy was Latinx or something. 

And B-Rad was like, 45% sure they loved this shit.

Something very interesting was surely going behind them.  Hid away from the rest of the world.  Safe from the sight of the B-Rads of the world.  Never to be dissed.  Never to be served.  Never to be dabbed on, if that was also a thing B-Rad did.  I am unclear on that.

With a mighty kick one of those temporary fold out bitch ass cubicle wall things falls over.  As it does so all the calendars and children's pictures and obnoxious motivational posters come loose and fly up into the air.  The wall itself hit a fat fuck in a polo shirt and khaki shorts.  The violent crash immediately liquifies right right shoulder and pushed his spinal cord out behind him.

"*Ohhhhh.  Oh god no.  Nooooo.  It hurts.  It hurts so much.  Why me.  What did I do wrong.  Please please finish me off.  The pain it is unbearable.  Grant me the sweet release of death I beg you.*"

He shouted out very quickly.  Surprisingly eloquent and clear given the state of his body.  He still sounded like a bitch though.  Surprisingly fitting actually because his spinal cord kind of looked like a tail, jutting out from his back like that, dripping blood and cerebral spinal fluid.

So he sounded like a bitch in the derogatory sense, moaning about how much that hurt, but he also looked like a bitch in the female dog sense due to the spinal tail.

Back up in not Cripple Bitch Loser Land stands Danger, Danger Fontaine.  Strong tree trunk like legs seemed to stretch his wrestling gear to the absolute limit of their spandexery.  Probably also his huge penis but only a gay would notice that.  You gay man.  I know you see it.  I seent you seenting it.  It's ok I don't judge.  The judges are here for that.  They all judge you gay.
